# Bitmap Representation of Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs)

This document outlines the method for visualizing Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) as bitmap images using the `DrawBitmap` method. Visualizing SDRs can significantly aid in understanding the patterns and information encoded within them, especially when dealing with complex encoders or spatial pooling processes. This method provides a tangible way to assess and interpret the activity and structure of SDRs, facilitating a deeper understanding of their functionality in various applications.
